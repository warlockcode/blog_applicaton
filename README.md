To build and install a Flutter application in Android Studio, follow these step-by-step instructions:

**Prerequisites:**

1. **Install Flutter:** If you haven't already, you need to install Flutter on your system. You can follow the official installation guide: [Flutter Installation](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

2. **Install Android Studio:** Make sure you have Android Studio installed and configured on your system. You can download it from the official website: [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

3. **Set Up an Emulator or Connect a Physical Device:** You can either set up an Android emulator in Android Studio or connect a physical Android device to your computer. Ensure that the emulator or device is detected and works correctly.

**Building and Installing a Flutter Application:**

1. **Open Android Studio:**

   Launch Android Studio and make sure it's properly configured with Flutter and Dart plugins. You should see a "Flutter" option in the Welcome screen.


4. **Configure the Device or Emulator:**

   - Ensure that your device or emulator is running and is visible in Android Studio. You can start an emulator by going to "Tools" > "AVD Manager" and launching a virtual device.

5. **Run Your Flutter Application:**

   - Click on the green "Run" (play) button in the top toolbar to run your Flutter application.
   - Select your target device or emulator from the list if prompted.
   - Android Studio will compile your Flutter code and launch the app on the selected device/emulator.

6. **View and Test Application:**

   Once the app is successfully built and installed, you can interact with it on the device/emulator to test its functionality.
